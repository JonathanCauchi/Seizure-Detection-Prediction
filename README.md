# Seizure-Detection-Prediction
Matlab code for seizure detection &amp; prediction. CHB-MIT dataset. Requires physio_pack for modules

Seizure detection model is trained on actual seizure data (it is trained to detect occuring seizures and not to predict them)

Seizure prediction model is trained on pre-ictal seizure data (2 mins before start of seizure to classify states before seizures)
